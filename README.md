## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

### Installation

_MacOS and Linux_
```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/install | REPO=shikaan/shmux sh -"

# or

sudo sh -c "wget -q https://shikaan.github.io/sup/install -O- | REPO=shikaan/shmux sh -"
```

_Windows and manual instructions_

Head to the [releases](https://github.com/shikaan/shmux/releases) page and download the executable for your system and architecture.

### Usage

A common use case for `shmux` is running simple scripts in a standardized and *language-agnostic* way (see [Other Languages](#other-languages)). 
These scripts are to be found in the _configuration_ file, also known as _shmuxfile_.

For example, a `shmuxfile.sh` for a Go project might look like: 

```sh
test:
  go test ./...

build:
  go generate
  GOOS=$1 go build

greet:
  echo "Hello $1, my old friend"

echo:
  echo "$@"  
```

Last two recipes in JavaScript that could looke like:

```js
// shmuxfile.js

greet:
  #!/usr/bin/env node

  const friend = "$1"
  console.log(`Hello ${friend}, my old friend`)

echo:
  #!/usr/bin/env node

  console.log(`$@`)
```

Which can then be utilized as

```bash
# Runs the test command
$ shmux test

# Runs the build command with "linux" as $1
$ shmux build -- "linux"

# Runs the greet command with "darkness" as $1
$ shmux greet -- "darkness" 
# => Hello darkness, my old friend
```

Recipes can have dependencies:

```sh
test:
  go test ./...

build: test
  go build
```

```bash
$ shmux build
```
Running `shmux build` will execute `test` before `build`.

## ‚ùì FAQs

* _Isn't this similar to a Makefile?_

  `shmux` draws inspiration from `make` but stands out as a script runner, not a build system. This distinction eliminates common build system constraintsl ike the presumption that outputs are files. Moreover, it offers:

  * Command line arguments support.
  * Compatibility with various scripting languages.
  * Pre-runtime issue detection.
  * Execution capability from any subdirectory.
  * Native support on MacOS and Windows, no extra dependencies required.

* _Which languages are supported?_
  
  `shmux` makes no assumptions about the underlying scripting language to utilize, because it always requires you to specify the shell (either via flag or shebang).

  To this day, `shmux` is known to be working with:

  * sh and derviatives (bash, dash, fish, zsh...)
  * JavaScript / TypeScript (with ts-node)
  * Perl
  * Python
  * Ruby

* _Does it have editor support?_

  As long as the language you choose is fine with having strings like `script:` in its syntax, you can just piggy-back on the existing editor support. 
  
  For example, if your _shmuxfile_ hosts JavaScript code, calling it `shmuxfile.js` will give you decent syntax highlighting out of the box in most editors.

  More sophisticated editor support may be coming soon. If you are interested, feel free to open an issue.
